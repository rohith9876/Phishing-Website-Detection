In this new implementation the code reads a dataset from 'dataset.csv', performs data preprocessing, and splits it into training and validation sets. It then constructs a customized feedforward neural network for binary classification using the TensorFlow Keras library. The model architecture includes Batch Normalization layers, Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation, and Dropout layers for regularization. It is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss, with additional metrics such as binary accuracy, precision, and recall. The training process involves early stopping to prevent overfitting, and the training history is visualized using Matplotlib. The summary metrics, including the best validation loss, accuracy, recall, and precision, are printed for evaluation. The goal is likely to achieve a well-performing binary classification model for the given dataset.

The Second code is a machine learning project for phishing detection using deep learning techniques. It starts by reading a dataset from 'phishing_database.csv' and 'whitelist.txt', assigning labels for supervised learning (0 for non-malicious and 1 for malicious). The text data is tokenized and preprocessed using a Tokenizer and padded sequences. The data is split into training and validation sets. The deep learning model is constructed using LSTM layers for sequence modeling, Dropout layers for regularization, and a Dense layer for binary classification. The model is compiled and trained on the training set with early stopping. After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set, and its accuracy is printed. The trained model is saved, and its predictions are stored. Additionally, the model's history is saved for future analysis. The overall goal of the code is to build and train a deep learning model for effective phishing detection.
